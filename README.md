# Titanic Survival Prediction - ML Project

This project explores the Titanic dataset and builds predictive models to classify passengers who survived or not, based on their features.

## 💡 Models Used
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

## 📊 Key Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- One-hot encoding of categorical features
- Model training and accuracy comparison
- Visualization of Decision Tree and Feature Importances

## 📁 Dataset
The dataset is publicly available from [Data Science Dojo's GitHub](https://github.com/datasciencedojo/datasets/blob/master/titanic.csv).

## 📌 Results
- Random Forest achieved the highest accuracy (~83%)
- Decision Tree and KNN were also evaluated
- Feature importances and tree visualization were created
